# Files deleted

The contents of this folder are apps that are to be removed from the /system/app folder so that

* they do not take up space in the /system partition (though not really useful)
* they do not start up and take up actual system memory (this part is useful)

Also note that the deleted items will remove "Corporate" support as I don't use them myself, but if you do you may want to fork this and remove those items from this folder.
